# Sound art project

The webpage is contained within the folder public_html this is the webpage root folder. The files `ART.txt`, `jquery.min.js`, `SculptureSound.m4a`, and `SculptureSound.wav` are not used currently in the project.

`ScultpureSound.wav` and `SculptureSound.m4a` are different versions of the original sound file that was recorded, we now however have split up the file and cut out some undesired bits and we end with 31 seperate sounds, each of these is included in the `Sound` folder.
